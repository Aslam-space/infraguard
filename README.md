## 🚀 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a **complete end-to-end CI/CD pipeline** for deploying a static website using **Jenkins, Docker, and AWS**, with monitoring and automated health checks.  

The goal is to showcase the **full DevOps lifecycle**:
- Code push → Automated build → Containerized deployment → Health monitoring → Cloud hosting

This pipeline ensures that every change in the repository is automatically deployed to the live environment with minimal manual intervention.
